inputs:
- resolution (should this be user input?  Require at least freq. wavelength/2 for scatter)
- lower altitude
- upper altitude
- turbulence (how to do this?)
	-input blobs (size, altitude, location)?
	-input dominant frequencies in plasma?
	-input equations for turbulence?
- bulk plasma motion?
- day or night
- solar activity

outputs:
- array of altitude x distance electron density

should include methods of implementing equations for turbulence/plasma evolution
need to take into account the curvature of earth

- ionosphere grid includes electron_density, drift_velocity, power_refl, spectral_width

in future: include time with altitude x distance.
	array with 3 dimensions, time, altitude, ground distance
